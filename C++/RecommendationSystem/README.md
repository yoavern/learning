**Movie Recommendation System**

Welcome to my final project for the C++ course! In this project, 
I have developed a movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions based on the user's previously rated movies. 
The system utilizes two distinct approaches: 
recommendation by content and recommendation according to collaborative filtering. 
The key behind these recommendations lies in the powerful concepts of linear algebra.
