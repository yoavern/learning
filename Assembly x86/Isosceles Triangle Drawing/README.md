A modular assembly 8086 program that draws isosceles triangles on the screen in four different rotations: 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.

## Description

This program allows the user to input various parameters to customize the isosceles triangle drawing:

1. Height of the triangle (negative number to end the program).
2. Number of spaces between characters.
3. Character used to draw the triangle.
4. Rotation degree of the triangle (0, 90, 180, 270).

After inputting the parameters, the program will display the isosceles triangle based on the provided specifications.
