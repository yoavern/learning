This is the final project for the course "Introduction to Computer Science" at the Hebrew University. My partner, Gal Bloch, and I collaborated on this project. Our objective was to create an interactive version of the game Boggle. Allow me to explain how the game works:

Boggle is a word game that challenges players to find as many words as possible within a predetermined set of letters. Typically, it is played on a 4x4 grid of letter cubes, although larger grids can also be used.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the game is played:

Setup: We begin by shaking a container filled with letter cubes, each featuring a different letter of the alphabet. The cubes are then randomly placed on the grid with the letters facing up.

Time Limit: A specific time limit, usually around three minutes, is set for players to form words.

Word Formation: Players must form words by connecting adjacent letters horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each cube can only be used once per word. Additionally, letters in a word must be connected in a continuous path, without any backtracking or jumping between non-adjacent cubes.

Scoring: Once the time limit is up, players compare their lists of words. Only valid words found in a standard dictionary are counted. Longer words and words with less common letters generally score higher points. Typically, a word must be at least three letters long to be considered.

Unique Words: If multiple players find the same word, it is typically counted only once. Each player scores points based on the words that are unique to their list.

Bonus Points: Some versions of Boggle include bonus points for finding particularly long words or using specific designated letters.

Highest Score Wins: After scoring, the player with the highest total score emerges as the winner. In the event of a tie, the player with the longest unique word or the most words wins.

Boggle can be played competitively, but it is also enjoyable as a solo activity or a casual game with friends and family. It is a fun and challenging word game that tests one's vocabulary, pattern recognition, and quick thinking skills.

I hope this revised explanation better conveys the details and rules of the Boggle game. If you have any further questions or need additional improvements, feel free to let me know!
